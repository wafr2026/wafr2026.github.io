## Getting around in Oulu 

### Cycling 

Oulu is Finland's most bicycle-friendly city and has an extensive network of cycling paths. These paths are seperated from the car traffic and flat, often running through scenic forests or along rivers, lakes, and the Baltic sea. The cycling paths are numbered and signposted so you will not get lost. A fleet of bicycles will be reserved for the WAFR participants who are interested in exploring the city on two wheels.

For short-term use, shared electric scooters and bicycles are widely available during summer and can be rented by the minute. You’re free to park them at your destination, as long as you follow local traffic rules. The two main operators are: [Lime](https://www.li.me/) and [Bird](https://www.bird.co/map/).

### Busses  

Oulu’s public transport system is based on buses and operated by the city. You can find up-to-date timetables and route information on the [Oulu Public Transportation website](https://www.osl.fi/en/). All busses accept contactless payment with bank cards. 

### Taxis  

Taxis are available throughout the city, with designated taxi ranks located in the city center and at the airport. Taxis can also be booked 24/7 by phone or via mobile apps. The two main taxi companies are [Otaxi](https://www.otaxi.fi/en/otaxi-services/otaxi-app/) and [FixuTaxi](https://fixutaxi.fi/). [Uber](https://www.uber.com/global/en/r/cities/oulu-northern-ostrobothnia-fi/?uclick_id=3ef0798f-4d41-4bd8-b9e0-a770fc872f67) is also available in Oulu. 

## Getting to the venue 

### Biking to the venue from the city center
